# MagicalBookCover
<i>Watch movie trailers on book covers.</i>

Magical Book Cover is an app that allows users to watch trailers about the book from book covers. The app provides a new way for customers to obtain information about a book theyâ€™re curious about via AR. (This is another app I've created with a tutorial from Udemy -- MagicalNewsPaper App)

<center><b>Note -- App only works with select titles and images from the Asset Folders on file:</b></center>
